  <h2>Description</h2>
  
  <p> This topic is about <span class = 'highlight'>digital mindfulness</span>. Digital mindfulness is about being mindful about the way we use technology. Many people end up spending way too much time on their phones without event realizing it. This can be quite damaging to our mental health as we mindlessly consume content after content. </p>

  <p> There's a huge problem with people procrastinating using technology rather than using it as a tool. This website will include links to articles for information about our use of digital technology.
  It will also include some ideas on how you can spend your time in other things.</p>

  <h3>Where can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
  <p>Social media is a tool which can at times be harmful to our mental health. Extensive use of social media can result in developing mental health problems and body image issues.

  <h3>Mindfulness. It's important to have an intention while using social media.</h3>
  <p>Practicing mindfulness while using social media is a great way to utilize this tool in productive ways. For example, you can look up on YouTube how to code a website in CSS and HTML, and giving your full undivided attention to the video. That means, no other videos playing in the background and not scrolling through your YouTube while the video is playing.

            Technology is a double-edged sword that can be used for good and bad. You can be part of the solution by taking the initiative to sign and help raise mental awareness. Every hour spent on social media can lead to mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, body image issues, and more. Spreading awareness and educating people about mental health can be a validation for those who struggle with it.
