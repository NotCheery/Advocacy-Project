  <h3>Mindfulness. It's important to have an intention while using social media.</h3>
  <p>Practicing mindfulness while using social media is a great way to utilize this tool in productive ways. For example, you can look up on YouTube how to code a website in CSS and HTML, and giving your full undivided attention to the video. That means, no other videos playing in the background and not scrolling through your YouTube while the video is playing.
